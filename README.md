# HP Victus - PipeWire DSP
Pipewire Audio DSP for internal speakers of HP Victus (15-fb2082wm)

Similar approach to [asahi-audio](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/asahi-audio/tree/main) (DSP for Apple M* MacBooks)  
Using convolution EQs, [bankstown](https://github.com/chadmed/bankstown) (bass enhancer) and volume-dependent EQ

Speaker response was measured using [Room EQ Wizard](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/), using the laptop mic. Also don't really know what I'm doing...

In operation:
